## **Prerequisites**
Before starting the migration, ensure you have:
1. **Azure Subscription**: An active Azure account with sufficient quotas for VMs, storage, and networking.
2. **Backup**: A full backup of your Hyper-V virtual machines.
3. **Azure Migrate Tool**: Installed and configured for your environment.
4. **Permissions**: Sufficient access to Azure and Hyper-V environments.

---

## **Step 1: Pre-Migration Planning**

### **1.1 Assess Your Environment**
- **Inventory**: Identify the servers you want to migrate.
- **Dependencies**: Analyze application dependencies and network configurations.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure OS and applications are supported in Azure.

### **1.2 Estimate Azure Resources**
- Use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) to estimate costs.
- Choose appropriate VM sizes based on current server performance.

### **1.3 Backup Data**
- Perform a full backup of your Hyper-V VMs to prevent data loss.

---

## **Step 2: Set Up Azure Infrastructure**

### **2.1 Prepare Azure Resources**
- Create an **Azure Resource Group** to organize resources.
- Set up a **Virtual Network (VNet)** with necessary subnets and **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**.

### **2.2 Configure Networking**
- Plan connectivity options such as VPN or ExpressRoute for seamless access.

---

## **Step 3: Prepare for Migration**

### **3.1 Set Up Azure Migrate**
1. Open **Azure Portal**.
2. Create a new Azure Migrate project under **Servers**.
3. Add the **Server Migration Tool**.

### **3.2 Install Azure Migrate Appliance**
1. Download the setup file from Azure Migrate.
2. Install the appliance on a Hyper-V host.
3. Register the appliance with your Azure Migrate project.

### **3.3 Discover Hyper-V VMs**
- Discover Hyper-V VMs using the Azure Migrate appliance.
- Validate compatibility and resolve any issues.

---

## **Step 4: Perform the Migration**

### **4.1 Start Migration**
1. Select the discovered Hyper-V VMs in Azure Migrate.
2. Configure replication settings:
   - Target Azure subscription.
   - Resource group, storage, and VM size.
3. Initiate the replication process.

### **4.2 Monitor and Test Migration**
- Monitor replication progress in the Azure Migrate portal.
- Perform a **Test Migration** to ensure functionality.

### **4.3 Complete the Migration**
- After successful testing:
  - Stop the on-premises VM.
  - Perform the **Final Failover** to migrate the VM to Azure.

---

## **Step 5: Post-Migration Configuration**

### **5.1 Validate the Azure VM**
- Verify VM functionality, network settings, and application performance.

### **5.2 Enable Backup**
- Use **Azure Backup** for disaster recovery.

### **5.3 Optimize Resources**
- Monitor performance using **Azure Monitor**.
- Adjust VM sizes or storage if needed.

### **5.4 Secure the VM**
- Enable **Azure Update Management** for patching.
- Configure security policies using **Azure Security Center**.

---

## **Step 6: Decommission On-Premises VM**
- Confirm the Azure VM's functionality over a defined period.
- Decommission the Hyper-V VM to free resources.
