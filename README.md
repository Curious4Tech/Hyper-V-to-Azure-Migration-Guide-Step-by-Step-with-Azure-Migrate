## Introduction
This guide provides detailed steps to migrate a server from Hyper-V to Azure using Azure Migrate.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- An active Azure subscription.
- Permissions to create VMs and write to Azure managed disks.
- Access to the Hyper-V host and VMs you want to migrate.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prepare Azure
- **Create an Azure Migrate project**: In the Azure portal, create a new project under the "Migration and Modernization" tool.
- **Verify Permissions**: Ensure your Azure account has the necessary permissions.

### Download and Configure the Azure Migrate Appliance
- **Download the Appliance**: Download the Azure Migrate appliance from the Azure portal.
- **Install the Appliance**: Install the appliance on a Hyper-V host.
- **Register the Appliance**: Register the appliance with your Azure Migrate project.

### Discover and Assess Hyper-V VMs
- **Discover VMs**: Use the Azure Migrate appliance to discover the Hyper-V hosts and VMs.
- **Create an Assessment**: Create an assessment to review the readiness and cost of migrating the VMs to Azure.

### Install Required Agents
- **Install Mobility Service**: Install the Mobility Service on the VMs to enable deeper discovery and dependency analysis.

### Enable Replication
- **Enable Replication**: Enable replication for the VMs to start copying data to Azure.
- **Monitor Progress**: Monitor the replication progress to ensure everything is running smoothly.

### Perform Test Migration
- **Test Migration**: Perform a test migration to ensure everything works as expected without any data loss.
- **Review Results**: Review the test migration results and make any necessary adjustments.

### Perform Final Migration
- **Final Migration**: Once the test migration is successful, perform the final migration with zero data loss.
- **Verify Network and DNS Settings**: Verify the network and DNS settings of the migrated VMs in Azure.

## Post-Migration Tasks
- **Test Functionality**: Test the functionality of the migrated VMs to ensure everything is working correctly.
- **Clean Up**: Clean up any resources that are no longer needed on the Hyper-V host.
